# PLEASEM
Place-based Estimated Advantages of Shared Electric Mobility online tool

PLEASEM is a basic tool using open data and conservative assumptions to visualise place-specific benefits from electric car clubs. 

For each upper tier LA, DfT data on total car VMT on the roads is divided by total cars registered, and then multiplied by the emissions from an ‘average’ car, as derived from the proportion of vehicles of each fuel type in the registered car fleet. PLEASEM shows the reduction in carbon emissions if this average mileage was instead driven in a fully electric or hybrid car. Although shared cars usually record greater annual mileage, they tend to reduce the annual VMT of multiple drivers of private cars, likely resulting in greater carbon savings. DfT data is updated annually.

We also use total cars and EVs registered per LSOA from DfT data and households per LSOA from ONS census 2021 data from England and Wales to calculate changes in car ownership rates and electric vehicle (EV) uptake by households. The maximum households per LSOA is just under 2000, so the number of registered vehicles per LSOA is capped at 4000.
